# Contacts-App
This project is a Contact Management App designed to efficiently store and manage contact information using Android Mobile App Studio (Java) and SQLite.
Displays all saved contacts as a list.
Users can search for contacts in real-time by entering key information, with the list dynamically updating based on the search input.
An icon on the main screen lets users add new contacts. Clicking it opens a blank EditContact screen where users can enter and save contact details.
By selecting a contact from the list, users are navigated to a Detail Screen that shows all the information for the selected contact. The detail screen includes two key actions:

Save Button/Icon: Updates or adds the contact and returns to the main screen.
Delete Button/Icon: Deletes the contact and navigates back to the main screen.
